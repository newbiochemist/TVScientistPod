### About

This is a space for scientists to tell their honest and authentic stories about their journey into science, highs and low they have faced or currently face during their careers in science, their hobbies and topics they would like to talk about on a public space with honesty to maintain authenticity.

The first episode of this podcast was a rant by Sarah Nyakeri, the host and producer of the podcast, who at the time was conducting her research and had a tough moment and shared it vulnerably on the podcast. Since there over 50 scientist have come into the podcasts and shared their stories. This episode was recorded and published on 1st December 2021, a weekday at 7pm. Since then, there has been an episode every weekday about at 7pm.

The podcast structure is interview-based, informal and relaxed and mostly long-form episodes. One guest covers 1-7 episodes depending on the topics and the length of the conversation.

### Reach: Statitics

This Github reository to make the Downloads data easy to acess. When the podcast started, It was being hosted on Buzzsprout. After while, Sarah thought that it won't be sustainable and the platfrom would delete the episodes if she doesn't pay for the hosting. At the end of March 2022, she moved the podcast to anchor, a free hosting platfromm but it didn't give her all the things she needed. Only after a few weeks, she moved to Acast, back to acnhor then finally settled for acast on Mid April 2022. This explains why the data is scattered.
