### Reach: Statitics

This Github reository to make the Downloads data easy to acess. When the podcast started, It was being hosted on Buzzsprout. After while, Sarah thought that it won't be sustainable and the platfrom would delete the episodes if she doesn't pay for the hosting. At the end of March 2022, she moved the podcast to anchor, a free hosting platfromm but it didn't give her all the things she needed. Only after a few weeks, she moved to Acast, back to acnhor then finally settled for acast on Mid April 2022. This explains why the data is scattered.
